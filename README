DESCRIPTION
    Template::Toolkit plugin HashMerge provides the Hash::Merge functions
    "merge" and "set_behaviour" to be used within templates.

    This can be useful in all cases a template works directly on data - e.g.
    when processing results from a query using Template::DBI and join the
    result with results from derived queries.

USAGE
      [% USE HashMerge %]
      [% HashMerge.set_behaviour( <behaviour name> );
         result = HashMerge.merge( hash1, hash2 ); %]

    Detailed function description and default behaviours are available in
    Hash::Merge.

    If you prefer to use virtual hash methods, see
    Template::Plugin::HashMergeVMethods.

FUNCTIONS PROVIDED
  merge
  get_behavior
  set_behavior
